        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SQL and Database Management Studio:</strong>
            <p>
              During my internship, I extensively worked with SQL to manage and
              query databases efficiently. I used Database Management Studio to
              perform various database operations, including creating and
              modifying database schemas, writing complex queries, and
              generating reports. This experience helped me develop a strong
              understanding of relational databases and their management.
            </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Understanding Database Technology:</strong>
            <p>
              I gained in-depth knowledge of database technologies, including
              how databases are structured, indexed, and optimized for
              performance. I learned about different types of databases and
              their applications in various business scenarios, which broadened
              my understanding of how data can be leveraged for strategic
              decision-making.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database Administration Skills :</strong>
            <p>
              In the role of a database administrator, I was responsible for
              managing database user accounts, setting up login procedures, and
              ensuring data security. I also performed regular backup and
              restore operations to maintain data integrity and availability.
              This hands-on experience equipped me with practical skills
              essential for maintaining robust and secure database systems.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High Availability Techniques:</strong>
            <p>
              To ensure high availability of database services, I learned about
              and implemented techniques such as<ul><li>database mirroring</li><li>Always On
                availability </li><li>clustering</li></ul> . These techniques are crucial
              for minimizing downtime and ensuring data redundancy. Database
              mirroring involves maintaining a copy of the database on a
              different server, while Always On availability groups allow for
              multiple databases to be replicated across different servers.
              Clustering provides a way to group multiple servers to work
              together, ensuring that if one server fails, another can take over
              seamlessly.

          <li>
            <strong>Application Deployment using IIS and SFTP:</strong>
            <p>
              I also gained experience in deploying applications using Internet
              Information Services (IIS) and Secure File Transfer Protocol
              (SFTP). Using IIS, I was able to set up, manage, and deploy web
              applications, ensuring they run smoothly on the server. I also
              used SFTP to securely transfer files between systems, which is
              essential for deploying updates and managing application files
              securely.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information Technology Infrastructure:</strong>
            <p>
              Beyond database management, I also gained exposure to the broader
              IT infrastructure within the bank. This included understanding
              network configurations, server management, and the integration of
              various IT systems. This holistic view of the IT environment
              enhanced my ability to see how databases fit into the larger
              picture of enterprise technology.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Additional Skills:</strong>
            <p>
              Throughout my internship, I developed several additional skills,
              such as effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
              Working in a dynamic and professional environment, I learned how
              to collaborate with colleagues from different departments and how
              to approach and solve technical issues efficiently.
